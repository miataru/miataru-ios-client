version 3.0
- Fixed `MiataruAPIClient` error propagation so API/request failures are no longer reclassified as `encodingError` in the generic `Encodable` POST helper.
- Suppressed user-facing overlays for technical request-encoding failures in map/history fetch flows and logged them as debug diagnostics instead.
- Documented retry guidance for transient network failures (timeouts/connection-loss) and explicitly excluded retries for encoding/decoding/auth errors.
- Extended Cursor rules: added changelog-on-commit rule and memory so CHANGELOG.md is updated at the top with the main app marketing version when committing, with a short summary of changes.
- Extended GetLocation and GetLocationHistory requests to send the requesting device key (`RequestMiataruDeviceKey`) from app and widgets, enabling server-side deviceID/deviceKey validation.
- Extended `MiataruClientSwift` for the new Device Slogan API (`setDeviceSlogan` / `getDeviceSlogan`) with typed request and response models.
- Added device info text support across My Device, Add Device, Edit Device, Visitor History, and Unknown Visitors with cached/fresh server sync for slogan and location updates on refresh intervals.
- Updated device info labeling from “Slogan/Device Slogan” to concise “Info” in add/edit flows and completed localization coverage, including the “Max 40 characters” helper text.
- Fixed remaining slogan localization gaps by replacing the hardcoded “Tap to set a slogan” hint and aligning invalid-server error messages to localized string keys in My Device and Edit Device flows.
